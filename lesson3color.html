    <h2>Color Scheme</h2>
    <p> Orange - #ffa64c</p>
    <p>Originally, I was going to have blue for my main background. However, when i got on the idea of making a Chamber of Commerce for Arizona, I thought an orange would give a desert feel.</p>
    <p>Light Blue - #6ee2ff</p>
    <p>This will be my call to action color, as it stand out form the orange. White text can also be easily seen on it, which also helps draw the eye to it, as most white text will be guiding the eye.</p>
    <p>White - #ffffff</p>
    <p>A nice white will stand out against the orange and contain paragraphs of text, helping draw the user to each portion of the site. Also, it will be used on the text that appears on the orange and blue part of the site.</p>
