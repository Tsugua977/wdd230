    <p>Alegreya</p>
    <p>This font stands out in a nice way, making it different from the paragraph fonts. By leaning into the font's flowy characteristic, it can be used to signal the users when a title occurs.</p>
    <p>Roboto</p>
    <p>This font is nice and clean, which is why I chose it for the paragraph fonts. It will help the users have a easy time reading the paragraphs. Also, it is extrely different for the Alegreya font, which helps signal to the users that this is not a title.</p>
    <p>Oswald</p>
    <p>I wanted this font to be on the call to action buttons. It stand out from the Alegreya and Roboto fonts, which helps differentiate it in its purpose. Even thoug it is a bit condensed, I think that might help draw the users to it in call to action senarios.</p>
